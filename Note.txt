- Localhost:3000 can't be connected or detected by Clerk because they are not in the same server to communicate.

- Webhook Proxy is an external service that sits in between the clerk(authentication service) and my server. It lives on my local laptop device. This webhook is used to expose a public
URL and a public domain.(For example: https://test-webhook.cloudflare.com, etc)
